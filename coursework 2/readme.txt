Program takes command-line arguments and creates a network, prints nodes and their children, prints total nodes and average number of children. 
'uniqueNodes' determines how many nodes should be made. 
'makeNetwork' creates a network and nodes.
Struct Network contains the number of nodes and a list of pointers to all the nodes.
Struct list contains the number of nodes per list and a pointer to the start of each list (of children). 
Tested 'uniqueNodes' and if network is made correctly. Tested number of nodes, number of children per node and the head of each list of children, is correct.
