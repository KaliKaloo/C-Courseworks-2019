The program takes in command line arguments and prints out the sign and 
bit structure of the number inputted to the correct amount of bits. 
If “char 7” is inputted, it will print out sign = 0 and binary = 00000111. 
This works for char (8 bits), int (32 bits), long (64 bits) and 
hexadecimals. This program also works for negative decimal and Hexidecimal 
numbers,and positive float numbers. I’ve tested all the functions except for 
toBinary and fTObin because I couldn’t figure out how to test it without 
having to return an array.
